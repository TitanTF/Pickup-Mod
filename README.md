### ConVars
Set the maximum number of entities a player can hold
```
sm_pickup_max
```

Drop all carrying entities on death
```
sm_pickup_drop 0/1
```

### Admin Commands
Use while looking at the entity you want to pickup to pick it up
```
sm_pickup
```

### Limitations
I have tried parenting the entity to the back of the player but it becomes invisible. Therefore, it currently moves frame by frame which causes a "laggy" entity moving behaviour.
